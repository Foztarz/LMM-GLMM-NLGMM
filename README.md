# LMM-GLMM-NLGMM
Some very basic examples intended to provide an introduction to hypothesis tests, linear modelling (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects modelling, generalised mixed-effects modelling, and non-linear (generalised) mixed-effect modelling in ```R```.
LMMs and GLMMs use the package ```lme4```, NLGMMs use ```brms``` to write Bayesian models in ```Stan```, using ```R``` as the main interface.
Models are run on simulated data, generated using a very basic model similar (but not identical) to the one that is fitted.

## Work in progress!
As of 13/06/2023 the LMM, GLMM and NLGMM scripts are mostly complete.
Markdowns of each script will be added in future versions.
