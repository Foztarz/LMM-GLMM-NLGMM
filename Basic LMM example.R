# Fit the maximal model ---------------------------------------------------
#	Fit the most complicated possible model							#

# You know a lot of variables that might have affected your data
# and it is a good idea to check if all (or any) did.
# You do this by fitting a model that has an effect of all variables
# and their interactions (the effect of specific combinations).
# The thing that you measured in your experiment is a
# "response" variable (it responds to the other factors),
# whereas the other factors are "predictor" variables
# (they might help you predict the response variable).
# These are "fixed" effects and their model is:
# response ~ predictor
# , which tells us that we can do something to the predictor
# to guess the response.

# Because individual identity is a proxy for many sources of variation
# they are considered a "random" factor and are entered
# into the model in a different way:
# response ~ (1|random_factor)
# for the intercept and
# response ~ (predictor|random_factor)
# for the slope, and
# response ~ (1+predictor|random_factor)
# for both.

# Mixing fixed and random effects gives us the model including 
# everything that might have an effect.
